# Deca

A text editor written in the D programming language. Based off the website [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) which is in turn based off of [kilo by antriez](https://github.com/antirez/kilo). Like 'kilo' the name 'deca' is a [decimal unit prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deca-). Kilo is 1000 in decimal while deca is 10. However deca attempts to match kilos origional goal of fitting in approximately 1000 lines of code, not 10.

Deca is run at the command line with the command `deca`.
